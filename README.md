# Give Me An Anime !
repo for the Apple Shortcut anime suggestor based on non offcial myanimelist.net API.

📣 No other language is supported (thanks Apple...) 📣

This shortcut allows you to suggest anime to watch based on your tastes and preferences!
iOS Version : >= 16.5 ( a version for iOS < 16.5 is coming soon )

**Here are the shortcut's key features:** 

- No API key required! ✅

- You can choose genres, types, minimum year required, minimum number of episodes etc. 🎯

- The anime is presented to you via a thumbnail including the following information: title, preview, synopsis, status, episodes, and its score! (https://imgur.com/a/lWSGp3r) 🖼️

- An anti-NSFW blurring filter is available (click on the image to make the filter disappear).

- It even has a customizable watchlist integrated into your Apple Notes! (https://imgur.com/a/DKU0JRW) 📒

- An updater is integrated to check is a new release is available for your iOS version ! ⤵️

⚠️Il is based on an unofficial API from myanimelist.com that contains no filters (hence the free use of service without API key). In other words, the more refined your tastes, the longer it may take for the anime to arrive, since many requests have to be made (it can take up to several minutes).

 ⚙️Exemple which works well: At first, I made this shortcut with the aim of executing it via automation; for example, when my alarm clock snoozes, the shortcut is launched (even if the iPhone is locked). While you're scratching out a few minutes (or even a quarter of an hour for some) of sleep time, the shortcut has time to find an anime by doing the queries, and when you're awake and you unlock your iPhone you've got a cool flyer with an anime to your taste waiting for you. Isn't it a beautiful day ahead? 😎

## FAQ

#### I got error "Couldn't communicate with the application helper"

This is an Apple Notes bug triggered by the *Add to watchlist* feature when Notes is already open on your iPhone. Try to close the Notes application and try again.

#### Shortcuts app crashes when i try to modify the lists in the setup.

This is an bug from the shortcuts apps for iOS < 16.5. There is currently no workaround so i would advise to change the lists direclty in the shortcuts body for now.

#### None of this answered my question !

Please open an [issue](https://github.com/m3dus444/Give-Me-An-Anime/issues/new) in this repository and give as many details as you can and I'll try to release a patched version asap.
