# Give Me An Anime !
repo for the Apple Shortcut anime suggestor based on non offcial myanimelist.net API.

📣 No other language is supported (thanks Apple...) 📣

This shortcut allows you to suggest anime to watch based on your tastes and preferences!
iOS Version : >= 16.5 ( a version for iOS < 16.5 is coming soon )

Here are the shortcut's key features: 

- No API key required! ✅

- You can choose genres, types, minimum year required, minimum number of episodes etc. 🎯

- The anime is presented to you via a thumbnail including the following information: title, preview, synopsis, status, episodes, and its score! (https://imgur.com/a/lWSGp3r) 🖼️

- An anti-NSFW blurring filter is available (click on the image to make the filter disappear).

- It even has a customizable watchlist integrated into your Apple Notes! (https://imgur.com/a/DKU0JRW) 📒

- Un updater is integrated in the shortcut, allowing future features & languages supports ⬇️

⚠️Il is based on an unofficial API from myanimelist.com that contains no filters (hence the free use of service without API key). In other words, the more refined your tastes, the longer it may take for the anime to arrive, since many requests have to be made (it can take up to several minutes).

 ⚙️Exemple which works well: At first, I made this shortcut with the aim of executing it via automation; for example, when my alarm clock snoozes, the shortcut is launched (even if the iPhone is locked). While you're scratching out a few minutes (or even a quarter of an hour for some) of sleep time, the shortcut has time to find an anime by doing the queries, and when you're awake and you unlock your iPhone you've got a cool flyer with an anime to your taste waiting for you. isn't it a beautiful day ahead? 😎
